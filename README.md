# the sticker protocol

> print digital stickers, imbue them with value, and trade them across the web

the sticker protocol is a public good and fully permissionless and open hyperstructure for selling, printing, trading, and redeeming digital stickers.

## welcome to DeFi Sticker.0

the sticker protocol eliminates [the mental transaction costs](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs/) of moving money on the internet — social micropayments are back, baby, and they're cooler than ever.

## protocol overview

a sticker is an individual ERC1155 NFT living on a dedicated OP Stack rollup in which transfers and trades are fully subsidized and account-abstracted. stickers, upon minting, are fully backed by mainnet frxETH, which is staked for risk-free yield. upon burning a sticker on the rollup, the backing mainnet frxETH is unstaked and returned.

as users react to their friends or creators around the web, the sticker NFTs are _transferred_, sending both meaning and money to another.

as non-fungible stores of frxETH, stickers have an _insane_ monetary premium and yield from the sfrxETH is streamed to protocol participants (platforms, artists, and others).

## technical details

### printing

artists provide sticker packs for printing. when a pack they've designed is minted, they earn a fee (calculated as `20%` of imbue value).

anyone can produce a sticker to be sold on any platform — they're just NFTs and follow the NFT Metadata standard. artists can use the full expressivity of solidity to restrict the supply of their stickers or how they're distributed.

anyone can write a UI to facilitate the minting of stickers, and claim a Finders Fee in exchange, giving them a pro-rata % of all yield generated by the ETH they facilitated the locking of. minting UIs *should not* charge an additional minting fee but ***can***—if they do so they should explicitly make that fact know in the breakdown of costs.

users print a sticker pack by providing the backing (frx)ETH, along with the artist's printing fee

ex: to mint a pack of 10 stickers backed by 0.0001 ETH each, the user pays 0.0012 (frx)ETH. 0.0002 frxETH goes directly to the artist, and each minted sticker is imbued with 0.0001 frxETH.

### sticker tiers

stickers have tiers of value, satisfying the requirement that users be able to contribute a lot of value in a single sticker interaction

| Tier | Color | Value (frxETH) | Est. Value (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common | White | 0.0001 | $0.2 |
| Uncommon | Green | 0.001 | $2 |
| Rare | Blue | 0.01 | $20 |
| Epic | Purple | 0.1 | $200 |
| Legendary | Orange | 1 | $2000 |

### mvp

for mvp purposes, the protocol is first developed as a single-chain hyperstructure. in the future cross-chain messaging and the dedicated OP Stack rollup can be employed

- [ ] storefront contract
  - [ ] hook-based logic for implementers
  - [ ] CREATE2-style deterministic token ids? allows for counterfactual listings
  - [ ] unowned
  - [ ] is it the job of the ui to verify that a sticker is saleable?
  - [ ] security?
- [ ] shared 1155 contract
  - [ ] redirect to mainnet renderer for tokenURI logic
