# the sticker protocol

> print digital stickers, imbue them with value, and trade them across the web

the sticker protocol is a public good and fully permissionless and open hyperstructure for selling, printing, trading, and redeeming digital stickers.

## welcome to DeFi Sticker.0

the sticker protocol eliminates [the mental transaction costs](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs/) of moving money on the internet — social micropayments are back, baby, and they're cooler than ever.

## protocol overview

a sticker is an individual ERC1155 NFT living on a dedicated OP Stack rollup in which transfers and trades are fully subsidized and account-abstracted. stickers, upon minting, are fully backed by mainnet frxETH, which is staked for risk-free yield. upon burning a sticker on the rollup, the backing mainnet frxETH is unstaked and returned.

as users react to their friends or creators around the web, the sticker NFTs are _transferred_, sending both meaning and money to another.

as non-fungible stores of frxETH, stickers have an _insane_ monetary premium and yield from the sfrxETH is streamed to protocol participants (platforms, artists, and others).

## technical details

### printing

artists provide sticker packs for printing. when a pack they've designed is minted, they earn a fee (calculated as `20%` of imbue value).

anyone can produce a sticker to be sold on any platform — they're just NFTs and follow the NFT Metadata standard. artists can use the full expressivity of solidity to restrict the supply of their stickers or how they're distributed.

anyone can write a UI to facilitate the minting of stickers, and claim a Finders Fee in exchange, giving them a pro-rata % of all yield generated by the ETH they facilitated the locking of. minting UIs *should not* charge an additional minting fee but ***can***—if they do so they should explicitly make that fact know in the breakdown of costs.

users print a sticker pack by providing the backing (frx)ETH, along with the artist's printing fee

ex: to mint a pack of 10 stickers backed by 0.0001 ETH each, the user pays 0.0012 (frx)ETH. 0.0002 frxETH goes directly to the artist, and each minted sticker is imbued with 0.0001 frxETH.

### sticker tiers

stickers have tiers of value, satisfying the requirement that users be able to contribute a lot of value in a single sticker interaction

| Tier | Color | Value (frxETH) | Est. Value (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common | White | 0.0001 | $0.2 |
| Uncommon | Green | 0.001 | $2 |
| Rare | Blue | 0.01 | $20 |
| Epic | Purple | 0.1 | $200 |
| Legendary | Orange | 1 | $2000 |

### mvp

for mvp purposes, the protocol is first developed as a single-chain hyperstructure. in the future cross-chain messaging and the dedicated OP Stack rollup can be integrated.

in the split-chain future we want minting-related logic (gating, total supply, etc) to be on mainnet
and we want display/trading (uri, royalty info, etc) logic available on the sidechain

## todo

- [ ] implement sticker burning with 1155 transfer data
- [ ] integrate with frxETH#permit along with standard allowances
- [ ] StickerPrinter hooks w/ trycatch
- [ ] storefront contract
  - [ ] hook-based logic for implementers
  - [x] CREATE2-style deterministic token ids? allows for counterfactual listings
  - [ ] unowned
  - [ ] is it the job of the ui to verify that a sticker is saleable?
  - [ ] security?
- [ ] shared 1155 contract
- [ ] vault contract that the storefront(?) can mint/burn from

can we encode information into the tokenId? 256 bits = 32 bytes, addresses are 20 bytes
so we have 12 left over. 1 for the tier, (really only 3 bits needed), then some space for the salt?

the space allotted to an id is basically the max length of a pack? 24 bits = 16,777,216 which is more than enough

so with this model tiers are managed by the protocol.
one registers salt+printer (impl) with the protocol.
ids are counterfactual — the protocol doesn't care, it just mints them

printers, when asked for uri, will parse out the id and return metadata
renderers will parse out tier to show status effects

why is salt here? salt is here because we want to use the same printer for multiple packs

artists deploy printer contracts to configure the style/logic of their stickers

|  uint8 |   uint8  |  8 bytes  |  20 bytes | = 32 bytes
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
|  tier  |    id    |   salt    |  printer  |

if we pack printer addresses into the token id we don't need the registry though, right?
yeah users just say "mint me these ids" and the storefront goes "ok"

so

could i have stickers be their own contracts? need to enforce minting rights, basically
the invariant i want to enforce is that for every sticker minted, FEE frxETH ends up in a vault and staked
so we want contracts to opt-in to say "i am a sticker" but also we need to enforce that invariant
this feels stressful because we can't trust external code to do expected things.
seems easier to use the hook
